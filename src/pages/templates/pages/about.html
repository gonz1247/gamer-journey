<h2>About</h2>
<p>
    Thank you for  visiting the about page to learn more about the Gamer Journey web app!
    <br><br>
    My name is <a href="https://github.com/gonz1247" target="_blank">Gonzo</a> and this the first web app I've made.
    I got the idea for this project since I am huge fan of video games, but also movies. For my movie watching hobby I
    use <a href="https://letterboxd.com/" target="_blank">Letterboxd</a> to track everything I am watching, so I thought
    it would be cool if there was a similar app for playing video games.
    <br><br>
    Currently, I am an aerospace engineer but, I am hoping to pivot my career to software engineering hopefully soon.
    I am hopeful that continuing to work on personal projects like Gamer Journey will help me to develop the skills and
    portfolio necessary to make the switch in careers.
    <br><br>
    Thanks again for checking out my project! Feel free to reach out with any feedback or suggestions though the
    <a href="\contact\">contact page!</a>
